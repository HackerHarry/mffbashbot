Harry's My Free Farm Bash Bot (MFF Bash Bot)
-------------------------------------------

README

Deutschsprachige: Schaut bitte in die README_DE Datei.

These files contain a bot for the browsergame "My Free Farm".
This software needs (among other things) PHP >=v5.4, jq >=v1.5 and Bash >=v4.3.

Be advised, that the use of bots is against the game providers' terms and
conditions. Your game account may be suspended by using this bot.
Use the bot scripts at your OWN RISK. You have been warned.

I want to encourage you, to support the game designers every now and then by
purchasing coins.

Coders may notice, that i'm not a coder by trade. But as long as my code works
(for me), it doesn't need to be pretty :)

This bot would not have seen the light of day without the superb work of
Bastian Kanaan. His 'Adviser' and 'Automaton' have been working for many gamers
reliably. Inspired by Bastian's Automaton, i started developing this bot. His
Adviser is still a loyal comapanion to me.

All the info you might need, can be found in the mffbashbot wiki.

If you feel obliged to make a donation for my work, i'll happily transmit my
PayPal details.
